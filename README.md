# trpl-server
A multi-threaded server that can handle concurrent requests. Inspired by the practice project in [TRPL (Chapter 20)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html)
* The project also involves an implementation of a `ThreadPool`, which can be found in [`src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/yuchenliang2001/trpl-server/blob/main/src/lib.rs).
